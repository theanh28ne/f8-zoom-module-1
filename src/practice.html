                                <p>If you or a loved one have been in an auto accident, you may be feeling overwhelmed
                                    and frustrated. The aftermath of a car accident can affect your personal and
                                    professional life as you deal with the physical, emotional, and financial burdens
                                    that an accident can cause. If you are struggling with the legalities of a car
                                    accident, then you want an experienced and knowledgeable car accident attorney by
                                    your side.</p>

                                <p>At The Rode Law Firm, a personal injury firm with locations in Tulsa and Sapulpa,
                                    Oklahoma, we are focused on client recovery from auto accidents and severe injuries.
                                    We represent people in the Tulsa, Sapulpa, Broken Arrow, Sand Springs, and Owasso,
                                    Oklahoma areas who have suffered injuries in car accidents by providing professional
                                    representation both in and out of the courtroom.</p>

                                <p>If you are involved in a car accident, the steps you take afterward directly affect
                                    your recovery. Having the nearest law enforcement agency investigate the wreck and a
                                    visit to the ER are prudent and highly recommended. Many injuries, such as a
                                    herniated disc or a concussion, may be disguised until weeks or months after the
                                    accident. Your well-being should be your number one priority.</p>

                                    any injuries you may have sustained, how your insurance company responds to your
                                    claim, and whether or not we need to go to trial. No matter what, your attorneys at
